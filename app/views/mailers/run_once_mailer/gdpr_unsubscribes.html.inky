            We are writing to let you know that <%= link_to(@unsubscribe[:person_name], @url) %> has contacted
            us, requesting that they be unsubscribed from future communications from Cru.
          </p>
          <p>
            New privacy laws recently came into effect and Cru sent an email to inform people of our updated
            privacy policy. In accordance with our legal obligations, this email went to everyone who
            regularly receives communication from us, including those marked in MPDX as receiving staff
            newsletters. It was in response to this communication that
            <%= link_to(@unsubscribe[:person_name], @url) %> replied indicated
            their preference to be unsubscribed.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important that we comply with this request. However, it is conceivable that
            <%= link_to(@unsubscribe[:person_name], @url) %> did not realize that you are affiliated
            with Cru, and maybe did not intend to unsubscribe from your newsletter. We suggest that
            you gently contact this person, to let them know that they have been unsubscribed, and
            ask them to confirm that they no longer wish to receive your newsletters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please take action in the next week by taking one of the following account:

          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Unsubscribe them from your newsletter list by marking them as opted out of email newsletter
                and changing their newsletter status. You can
                <%= link_to('click here',
                            'https://mpdx.helpscoutdocs.com/article/448-contacts-unsubscribed-from-new-privacy-policy') %>
                to learn how to unsubscribe this person, or email our help team at
                <%= mail_to('support@mpdx.org') %>.
              </li>
              <li>
                OR by gaining their consent to continue to receive your newsletter.

          </p>
          <p>
            In either case, please reply to this email, letting us know what action you have taken.
            <strong>If we do not hear from you by Monday, June 18th, we will unsubscribe them in MPDX,
              on your behalf.</strong>
