Description:
    Similar to the rails controller generator, but will template out the
    controller actions to follow examples from the book
    "Growing Rails Applications In Practice".

    Stubs out a new controller and a spec. Pass the controller name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored.

    To create a controller within a module, specify the controller name as a
    path like 'parent_module/controller_name'.

    This generates a controller class in app/controllers, a spec in
    spec/controllers, and an acceptance spec in spec/acceptance.

Example:
    `rails generate graip:controller Api/v2/Contacts`

    This will generate:
      Controller:      app/controllers/api/v2/contacts_controller.rb
      Controller Spec: spec/controllers/api/v2/contacts_controller_spec.rb
      Acceptance Spec: spec/acceptance/api/v2/contacts_spec.rb
