      For this bulk create endpoint, you are *required* to send an array of items within the `data` object.
      You are also *required* to send in a related Person. A Person cannot be created without a Contact.

      - Each member of the array _must_ contain a _client generated `id`_ to be used for the Person being created.
      - Each member of the array _must_ contain a `type` that has the value of `'people'`.
      - Each member of the array _must_ have an `attributes` hash of values to be used for the Person being created.
