      ```json
      {
        "data": {
          "type": "notification_preferences",
          "id": "1d6393dd-f3f4-49d3-9fd8-7e758b056b1f",
          "attributes": {

            "task": false
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      For this bulk create endpoint, you are *required* to send an array of items within the `data` object.
      You are also *required* to send in a related Notification Type. A Notification Preference cannot be created without a Notification Type.

      - Each member of the array _must_ contain a _client generated `id`_ to be used for the Notification Preference being created.
      - Each member of the array _must_ contain a `type` that has the value of `'notification_preferences'`.
      - Each member of the array _must_ have an `attributes` hash of values to be used for the Notification Preference being created.
