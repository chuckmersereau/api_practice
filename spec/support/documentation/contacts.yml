      - Each member of the array _must_ contain a _client generated `id`_ to be used for the Contact being created.
      - Each member of the array _must_ contain a `type` that has the value of `'contacts'`.
      - Each member of the array _must_ have an `attributes` hash of values to be used for the Contact being created.
