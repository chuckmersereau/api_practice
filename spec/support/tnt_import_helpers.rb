Jesus said, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him” (John 7:37, 38).\nWhat did Jesus mean? John, the biblical author, went on to explain, “By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified” (John 7:39).\nJesus promised that God’s Holy Spirit would satisfy the thirst, or deepest longings, of all who believe in Jesus Christ. However, many Christians do not understand the Holy Spirit or how to experience Him in their daily lives.\n\u0084 The following principles will help you\n\nunderstand and enjoy God’s Spirit.The Divine Gift Divine: (adj.) Given by God\tGod has given us His Spirit so that we can experience intimacy with Him and enjoy all He has for us.\t\nThe Holy Spirit is the source of our deepest satisfaction.\nThe Holy Spirit is God’s permanent presence with us.\nJesus said, “And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever-the Spirit of truth” (John 14:16, 17).\nThe Holy Spirit enables us to understand and experience all God has given us.\n“We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us” (1 Corinthians 2:12).\nThe Holy Spirit enables us to experience many things:\n•\tA genuine new spiritual life (John 3:1-8).\n•\tThe assurance of being a child of God (Romans 8:15, 16).\n•\tThe infinite love of God (Romans 5:5; Ephesians 3:18, 19).\nLife Without the Spirit\tLife With the Spirit\t\nBefore Receiving Christ\tAfter Receiving Christ\t\n\t\nThe man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. (1 Corinthians 2:14).\tThe spiritual man makes judgments about all things… We have the mind of Christ (1 Cor. 2:15, 16). But those who are controlled by the Holy Spirit think about things that please the Spirit (Romans 8:5, NLT).\t\n\u0084 Why are many Christians not satisfied\n\nin their experience with God?\nThe Present Danger Danger: (n.) a thing that may cause injury, loss, or pain\tWe cannot experience intimacy with God and enjoy all He has for us if we fail to depend on His Spirit.\t\nPeople who trust in their own efforts and strength to live the Christian life will experience failure and frustration, as will those who live to please themselves rather than God.\nWe cannot live the Christian life in our own strength.\n“Are you so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now trying to attain your goal by human effort?” (Galatians 3:3).\nWe cannot enjoy all God desires for us if we live by our self-centered desires.\n“For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want” (Galatians 5:17).\nThree Kinds of Lifestyles\nA Self-centered Life\tA Christ-centered Life\tA Self-centered Life\t\nBefore Receiving Christ\tAfter Receiving Christ \t\n\t\n “Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual, but as worldly-mere infants in Christ. I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready. You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere men?” (1 Corinthians 3:1-3).\t\n\u0084 How can we develop a lifestyle\n\nof depending on the Spirit?The Intimate Journey Journey: (n.) any course from one experience to another\tBy walking in the Spirit we increasingly experience intimacy with God and enjoy all He has for us.\t\nWalking in the Spirit moment by moment is a lifestyle. It is learning to depend upon the Holy Spirit for His abundant resources as a way of life.\nAs we walk in the Spirit, we have the ability to live a life pleasing to God.\n“So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature…Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit” (Galatians 5:16, 25).\nAs we walk in the Spirit, we experience intimacy with God and all He has for us.\n“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control” (Galatians 5:22, 23).\nThe Christ-centered Life\t\n \t\nFaith (trust in God and His promises) is the only way a Christian can live by the Spirit.\nSpiritual breathing is a powerful word picture which can help you experience moment-by-moment dependence upon the Spirit.\nExhale: Confess your sin the moment you become aware of it-agree with God concerning it and thank Him for His forgiveness, according to 1 John 1:9 and Hebrews 10:1-25. Confession requires repentance-a change in attitude and action.\nInhale: Surrender control of your life to Christ, and rely upon the Holy Spirit to fill you with His presence and power by faith, according to His command (Ephesians 5:18) and promise (1 John 5:14, 15).\n\u0084 How does the Holy Spirit fill us with His power?\nThe Empowering Presence Empower: (v.) to give ability to\tWe are filled with the Spirit by faith, enabling us to experience intimacy with God and enjoy all He has for us.\t\nThe essence of the Christian life is what God does in and through us, not what we do for God. Christ’s life is reproduced in the believer by the power of the Holy Spirit. To be filled with the Spirit is to be directed and empowered by Him.\nBy faith, we experience God’s power through the Holy Spirit.\n“I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith” (Ephesians 3:16, 17).\nThree important questions to ask yourself:\n1.\tAm I ready now to surrender control of my life to our Lord Jesus Christ? (Romans 12:1, 2)\n2.\tAm I ready now to confess my sins? (1 John 1:9) Sin grieves God’s Spirit (Ephesians 4:30). But God in His love has forgiven all of your sins-past, present, and future-because Christ has died for you.\n3.\tDo I sincerely desire to be directed and empowered by the Holy Spirit? (John 7:37-39)\nBy faith claim the fullness of the Spirit according to His command and promise:\nGod COMMANDS us to be filled with the Spirit.\n“…be filled with the Spirit” (Ephesians 5:18).\nGod PROMISES He will always answer when we pray according to His will.\n“This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears us-whatever we ask-we know that we have what we asked of him” (1 John 5:14, 15).\n\u0084 How to pray to be filled with the Holy Spirit…\n\f\n\nThe Turning Point Turning point: time when a decisive change occursWe are filled with the Holy Spirit by faith alone.\t\t\nSincere prayer is one way of expressing our faith. The following is a suggested prayer:\nDear Father, I need You. I acknowledge that I have sinned against You by directing my own life. I thank You that You have forgiven my sins through Christ’s death on the cross for me. I now invite Christ to again take His place on the throne of my life. Fill me with the Holy Spirit as You commanded me to be filled, and as You promised in Your Word that You would do if I asked in faith. I pray this in the name of Jesus. I now thank You for filling me with the Holy Spirit and directing my life.\nDoes this prayer express the desire of your heart? If so, you can pray right now and trust God to fill you with His Holy Spirit.\nHow to know that you are filled by the Holy Spirit\n•\tDid you ask God to fill you with the Holy Spirit?\n•\tDo you know that you are now filled with the Holy Spirit?\n•\tOn what authority? (On the trustworthiness of God Himself and His Word: Hebrews 11:6; Romans 14:22, 23.)\nAs you continue to depend on God’s Spirit moment by moment you will experience and enjoy intimacy with God and all He has for you-a truly rich and satisfying life.\nAn important reminder…\nDo Not Depend on Feelings\nThe promise of God’s Word, the Bible-not our feelings-is our authority. The Christian lives by faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of God Himself and His Word. Flying in an airplane can illustrate the relationship among fact [God and His Word], faith [our trust in God and His Word), and feeling (the result of our faith and obedience] (John 14:21).\nTo be transported by an airplane, we must place our faith in the trustworthiness of the aircraft and the pilot who flies it. Our feelings of confidence or fear do not affect the ability of the airplane to transport us, though they do affect how much we enjoy the trip. In the same way, we as Christians do not depend on feelings or emotions, but we place our faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of God and the promises of His Word.\nNow That You are Filled with the Holy Spirit\nThank God that the Spirit will enable you:\n•\tTo glorify Christ with your life (John 16:14).\n•\tTo grow in your understanding of God and His Word (1 Corinthians 2:14, 15).\n•\tTo live a life pleasing to God (Galatians 5:16-23).\nRemember the promise of Jesus:\n“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth” (Acts 1:8).\n\nappendix B\nWould You Like to Know God Personally?\nAppendix B: Would You Like to Know God Personally?\nWould You Like to\n\nKnow God Personally?This booklet contains a message of love and hope. An exciting adventure awaits all who discover these life-changing truths. The following four principles will help you discover how to know God personally and experience the abundant life He promised.\nGod’s PerspectiveGod loves you and created you to know Him personally. He has a wonderful plan for your life.\t\t\nGod’s Love\n“For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life“ \n\n(John 3:16, NIV).\nGod’s Plan\n“Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent” (John 17:3).\n\u0084 What prevents us from knowing God personally?\nOur ConditionPeople are sinful and separated from God, so we cannot know Him personally or experience His love and plan.\t\t\nPeople are Sinful\n“…for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God”\n\n(Romans 3:23).\nPeople were created to have fellowship with God; but, because of our stubborn self-will, we chose to go our own independent way and fellowship with God was broken. This self-will, characterized by an attitude of active rebellion or passive indifference, is evidence of what the Bible calls sin.\nPeople are Separated\n“For the wages of sin is death” [spiritual separation from God] (Romans 6:23).\n\tThis diagram illustrates that God is holy and people are sinful. A great gulf separates the two. The arrows illustrate that people are continually trying to reach God and establish a personal relationship with Him through our own efforts, such as a good life, philosophy, or religion, but we inevitably fail.\t\n\u0084 The third principle explains the only way\n\nto bridge this gulf…\nGod’s Response\tJesus Christ is God’s only provision for our sin. Through Him alone we can know God personally and experience God’s love and plan.\t\nHe Died in Our Place\n“But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8).\nHe Rose From the Dead\n“…Christ died for our sins … He was buried, He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures … He appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. After that, He appeared to more than five hundred …” (1 Corinthians 15:3-6).\nHe is the Only Way to God\n“Jesus answered, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me’” (John 14:6).\n\tThis diagram illustrates that God has bridged the gulf that separates us from Him by sending His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross in our place to pay the penalty for our sins.\t\n\u0084 It is not enough just to know these truths…\nOur Response\tWe must individually receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord; then we can know God personally and experience His love and plan.\t\nWe Must Receive Christ\n“Yet to all who received Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God” (John 1:12).\nWe Receive Christ Through Faith\n“For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith-and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-not by works, so that no one can boast” (Ephesians 2:8,9).\nWhen We Receive Christ, We Experience a New Birth (Read John 3:1-8).\nWe Receive Christ by Personal Invitation\n[Christ speaking] “Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with Me” (Revelation 3:20).\nReceiving Christ involves turning to God from self (repentance) and trusting Christ to come into our lives to forgive us of our sins and to make us what He wants us to be. Just to agree intellectually that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died on the cross for our sins is not enough. Nor is it enough to have an emotional experience. We receive Jesus Christ by faith, as an act of the will.\nThese two circles represent two kinds of lives.\nA life without Jesus Christ. Self is in the center and on the throne; Christ (†) is outside.\t\tA life entrusted to Christ. Christ is in the center and on the throne, and self yields to Christ.\t\nWhich circle best describes your life?\n\nWhich circle would you like to have represent your life?\n\u0084 The following explains how\n\nyou can receive Christ…\nYou Can Receive Christ Right Now by Faith Through Prayer\n(Prayer is talking with God)\nGod knows your heart and is not as concerned with your words as He is with the attitude of your heart. The following is a suggested prayer:\nLord Jesus, I want to know You personally. Thank You for dying on the cross for my sins. I open the door of my life and receive You as my Savior and Lord. Thank You for forgiving me of my sins and giving me eternal life. Take control of the throne of my life. Make me the kind of person You want me to be.\nDoes this prayer express the desire of your heart?\nIf it does, pray this prayer right now, and Christ will come into your life, as He promised.\nHow to Know That Christ is in Your Life\nDid you receive Christ into your life?\nAccording to His promise as recorded in Revelation 3:20, where is Christ right now in relation to you? Christ said that He would come into your life and be your Savior and friend so you can know Him personally. Would He mislead you? On what authority do you know that God has answered your prayer? (The trustworthiness of God Himself and His Word.)\nThe Bible Promises Eternal Life to All Who Receive Christ\n“And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life” (1 John 5:11-13).\nThank God often that Christ is in your life and that He will never leave you (Hebrews 13:5). You can know on the basis of His promise that Christ lives in you and that you have eternal life from the very moment you invite Him in.\n\u0084 An important reminder…\nDo Not Depend on Feelings\nThe promise of God’s Word, the Bible-not our feelings-is our authority. The Christian lives by faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of God Himself and His Word. Flying in a jet can illustrate the relationship among fact (God and His Word), faith (our trust in God and His Word), and feeling (the result of our faith and obedience) (see John 14:21).\n\n\nTo be transported by a jet, we must place our faith in the trustworthiness of the aircraft and the pilot who flies it. Our feelings of confidence or fear do not affect the ability of the jet to transport us, though they do affect how much we enjoy the trip. In the same way, we as Christians do not depend on feelings or emotions, but we place our faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of God and the promises of His Word.\nNow That You Have Entered Into a Personal Relationship With Christ\nThe moment you received Christ by faith, as an act of your will, many things happened, including the following:\n• \tChrist came into your life (Revelation 3:20 and Colossians 1:27).\n•\tYour sins were forgiven (Colossians 1:14).\n•\tYou became a child of God (John 1:12).\n•\tYou received eternal life (John 5:24).\n•\tYou began the great adventure for which God created you (John 10:10; 2 Corinthians 5:17 and 1 Thessalonians 5:18).\nCan you think of anything more wonderful that could happen to you than entering into a personal relationship with Jesus Christ? Would you like to thank God in prayer right now for what He has done for you? By thanking God, you demonstrate your faith.\n\u0084 To enjoy your new relationship with God…\nSuggestions For Christian Growth\nSpiritual growth results from trusting Jesus Christ. “…The righteous will live by faith” (Galatians 3:11). A life of faith will enable you to trust God increasingly with every detail of your life, and to practice the following:\n\f\n\n\tG\tGo to God in prayer daily (John 15:7).\n\tR\tRead God’s Word daily (Acts 17:11)-begin with the Gospel of John.\n\tO\tObey God moment by moment (John 14:21).\n\tW\tWitness for Christ by your life and words (Matthew 4:19; John 15:8).\n\tT\tTrust God for every detail of your life (1 Peter 5:7).\n\tH\tHoly Spirit-Allow Him to control and empower your daily life and witness (Galatians 5:16,17; Acts 1:8).\nRemember\nYour walk with Christ depends on what you allow Him to do in and through you empowered by the Holy Spirit, not what you do for Him through self effort.\nFellowship in a Good Church\nGod’s Word admonishes us, “Let us not give up meeting together…” (Hebrews 10:25). Several logs burn brightly together; but put one aside on the cold hearth and the fire goes out. So it is with your relationship with other Christians. If you do not belong to a church, do not wait to be invited. Take the initiative; call the pastor of a nearby church where Christ is honored and His Word is preached. Start this week, and make plans to attend regularly.\n\nIf you still have questions, visit:\nwww.whoisJesus-really.com or www.everystudent.com",
