# There was a bug in the Tnt import that would make it so when someone
# imported from Tnt and they had multiple organizations, MPDX could
# incorrectly associate some of their donor accounts with the wrong
# organization.
# Because of the way the contact merge logic works (just considering
# donor account numbers not organizations), when people merged contacts
# together, donations would disappear.
#
# These functions allow you to correct a user's account by going through
# their donor accounts and setting those that were incorrectly labeled.
#
# The first two methods donor_accounts_counts_by_org and empty_donor_accounts
# allow you to look up what donor accounts an account list has to diagnose which
# organization was incorrectly assigned to some of their donor accounts.
#
# Then to correct the problem, call fix_all_donor_accounts with the account
# list, the org that was wrongly set and the correct org.
#
# For instance, if someone is from Canada and they imported from TntMPD but a
# lot of their donor accounts got marked as as Cru USA incorrectly, then you
# would call the method like this:
#
# ptc = Organization.find_by(name: 'Power to Change - Canada')
# fix_all_donor_accounts(account_list, Organization.cru_usa, ptc)

# Gives an overview of the organizations that are in an account's donors to help
# diagnose which organization might have been wrongly added by the Tnt import.
def donor_accounts_counts_by_org(account_list)
  account_list.donor_accounts.group(:organization_id).count
end

# Shows the empty donor accounts for an account list, helpful for diagnosing
# which organization was incorrectly set onto their account lists.
def empty_donor_accounts(account_list)
  account_list.donor_accounts.select do |da|
    da.donations.count.zero?
  end
